This project has been created by following a [freecodecamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-personal-website-with-next-js-13-sanity-io-tailwindcss-and-typescript/) for integrating Next 13 with Sanity, using Typescript and Tailwind.

The [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The Sanity project is set up separately then incorporated into the Next app's structure.
